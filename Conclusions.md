# Conclusions

Hyperscale (Citus) on Azure Database for PostgreSQL enables you to distribute your data and your queries across a Postgres database cluster (what we call a ‘server group’), giving your application the performance benefits of all the memory, compute, and disk available on all the nodes in the server group. 

In this lab you’ve learned how to scale out Postgres horizontally on Microsoft Azure by provisioning a database cluster and configuring the sharding key.

More specifically you learned how to:

-	Provision a Hyperscale (Citus) server group on Azure Database for PostgreSQL
-	Create an Azure Cloud Shell
-	Connect to your Hyperscale (Citus) server using PSQL
-	Create a schema, define the sharding key, and load the data into the server group
